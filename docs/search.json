    "text": "The day started early. Actually, the day started in the middle of a dark, freezing night. Stockholm in December is not a place where you come for sunbathing. A man had a more pragmatic reason for his visit: at a humble age of 48, he was about to deliver a Nobel lecture.\nThis is how it might look like for the most of Nobel laureates, I believe. This particular prize was awarded in the field near and dear to my heart, chemistry. However, a sentence which particularly sticked to me from the lecture is “playing chess seriously at such young age is a very formative experience”. Demis Hassabis received 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry1 for artificial intelligence algorithm Alphafold. Let’s focus for a moment on the name. “Alpha” is first letter of Greek alphabet; “fold” is a part of the name that makes a link to chemistry. Proteins fold, to be able to fulfill their function, let it be muscle contraction, food digestion or human cells penetration (by a bacterial protein). Most biological processes depend on proteins being properly shaped. Proteins acquire their unique shape/3D structure/fold, as a result of folding process. Alphafold is an algorithm that delivers 3D structure predictions of astonishing accuracy. And to give you a glimpse of an idea what a protein shape can be, here are few exemplary PDB entries:\nYes, Mother Nature’s imagination is always way beyond our own.\nHave you ever heard about AlphaGO? Another AI algorithm, that in 2016 infamously beaten world champion Ke Jie in Go, an ancient board game with an estimated 10^170 possible moves in a typical match. Way more moves than atoms in the Universe. Hassabis is also a man behind AlphaGO. And he used to be a competitive chess player. So what chess, chemistry and GO have in common, besides the person of Hassabis?\nI had a conversation on this Nobel prize with my PhD supervisor, years after I left academia. While for both of us having reliable structure predictions of all proteins ever seen in nature at the tips of our fingers is mind blowing, my former promoter put it in an interesting context. The genius behind Alphafold lies not in its output, but in its input. Also, it lies in selection of protein folding as a problem to be tackled. “That’s an excellent problem! And they started from the most accurate, most scrutinized dataset one can imagine”. My promoter referred to PDB, the protein data bank, a public repository of protein structures. It stores experimentally determined proteins’ shapes. When deposited to PDB, a structure is given its quality passport. The passport is composed of a few metrices, well defined and widely accepted (think of it as of game score). After deposition itself, the structure usually goes under an extra round of surveillance, in the process of publishing a scientific article. It is not far fetched to say that careers of multiple scholars depend on quality of structures they deposited in the PDB. Have you ever encountered more scrutinized data?\nAnd then protein folding itself: atoms of proteins have to occupy space, and connections between these atoms are constrained by lengths of chemical bonds. Similarly, chess have to move on the chess board and knight is constrained in its moves by L-shape. As such, solutions to both, have to be a matter of finding such combination of moves in the space that do not violate the constrains and maximize the score. They are so called combinatorial problems. Here we come to the point when I can say what a suitable AI problem is.\nIf you can frame a problem as a combinatorial problem, it can potentially benefit from AI. Next, you need data. If high quality data from the solution space of your problem are available or can be easily generated, it makes an excellent problem for AI. This is what my promoter meant by protein folding being an excellent problem. Protein folding has another feature which I think makes it worthy to be tackled: it is important. Knowledge of protein’s shapes is crucial to understand diseases, develop effective therapies and predict how mutations might affect function. So here is a recipe for a problem that in my mind is a truly remarkable one for AI: it is important, it can be framed as combinatorial and relevant high quality data are avaialable. As the plot below emphasizes, only a fraction of combinatorial problems are important. In hindsight, there was a reason why AlphaGo was retired after winning against Go world chempion. Still, it is data availability that remains the bottleneck, separating problem from awaited solution. If you want to have a chance for an excellent solution, aim for this sweet spot. And thank you for reading."

    "text": "I am laying just a tiny bit by saying I learned how to read plots at the second year of the university. In winter semester 2008/09 I had thermodynamics course and it was the 1st time I anticipated the breadth of information that a curve can pass. It was mesmerizing that derivatives and integrals, so enigmatic in the mathematics course a year earlier, can have physical interpretation. That with a blink of an eye you can have an idea on a state of a system, without solving any equation. I felt like I got a new lens to interpret any information I am given in a plot form.\nThose of you who were better students at physics classes in high school could say, “well done, you could have reached that reflection at least few years earlier”. True. However, there is a unique lesson I drew from my thermodynamics classes that makes me a better/more resilient investor now. It is a lesson on state functions.\nI will explain it with a plain chemical reaction, that your body is carrying out right now. Chemists are always interested in energetic balance of the reaction, namely whether reaction releases or requires energy to proceed, and how much. It is an important consideration in the lab set-up: whether you have to prep a heater to heat up the beaker or you can burn yourself if touching the beaker with reactants. The whole complication is that chemistry is a science of different paths. Often there are multiple ways to get from A to B (eg. via C, via D or directly, to name just a few). So it is a natural question to ask, which way can you get the most energy of the system? While you are reading these sentences, your brain runs on glucose. Glucose is a simple sugar. It is burned in the cells of your body to release energy for more interesting stuff downstream, like eg. interpreting sentences in this post. Burning glucose is a such fundamental process, that it is done by all organisms throughout evolutionary tree. Bacteria do it and chimpanzee do it*. In addition, monkey in a lab coat can do it also in a full stream of oxygen.\n\\[\\ce{C6H12O6 + 6O2 -&gt; 6CO2 + 6H2O}\\]\nThe later however, is a single step reaction. You go from glucose immediately to carbon dioxide and water. Game over, nothing more to oxidize. It is quite brute force approach in comparison to elegant biological oxidation of glucose, that involves more than dozen intermediate reactions, multiple enzymes, different cellular locations and ends with a cycle (sic!):\n\n Fig.1. Schematic representation of Krebs cycle, a pinnacle of biochemistry. Find at least one molecule of \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) and one molecule of \\(\\ce{H2O}\\).\n\nSo here we are, ~500 words further, and back to the original question: which path will release more energy? And the answer is… they both release same energy. It is because start (glucose and oxygen) and end (water and carbon dioxide) are in both cases the same. For energy calculations, the path taken from substrates to products is irrelevant.\nIn short, “path does not matter” is the definition of function state.\nIf one would like to represent it on a plot, it would look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Energy profiles for single vs. multi-stage reactions"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Winter 2020/21 was the timing of my maternity leave. The world was spinning after surreal 2020 spring but with numbers on infections and hospitalisations order of magnitude higher, and with no vaccine in sight. Meeting people outdoors was the only possible form of socializing. Having data from my first child who was much better sleeper outside than inside, I had already two reasons for long daily walks. Luckily, a friend of mine had a baby in the same time, so that I had someone to socialize with. Together with Carmen we spent hours in crispy air, strolling, eating cakes from Julie’s house and talking. One day I remember convincing her to make one extra round in the park, because I knew the moment I return home my son will wake up and claim, lound and clear, his milk. ‘Caveman baby.’ she said, and I gazed at her. ‘When you reach home it is a sign that the walk for today is over. In the place where air is stagnated everyone is safe. So he can remind you of his existance and “ask” for feeding’.\nShe was outlaying analogies to the lifestyle of hunter gatherers - nomadic movement, cave, predators at bay. Despite the fact how well researched is this particular claim (Carmen, go for it!), Homo sapiens spent only a fraction of their existence as non-nomads. Aproximately 10%. Evolutionary luggage is the heavier the longer it was carried. As such we are genetically shaped more by hunter gatherers than by any lifestyle that followed (sedentary, with artificial light or with artificial intelligence - pick up one for this lost competition). It makes perfect sense that babies are naturally wired to sleep outdoors and to start crying when you enter home. Or stop on a red light, if you are a car person.\nSleeping preferences of babies is something that make many parents sleepless. Co-sleeping or not co-sleeping? How old is too old for milk at night? Should you comfort when it cries or let it cry-it-out? Or something in between and if yes, after how much time? When to move a baby to their room? Every parent was confronted with these questions, and every future parent will be. Cultural pressures. Timeline of a newborn can be viewed as a recency example, too. A few month old baby is exposed to cultural pressures regarding sleep, feeding and comfort seekeing for a relatively short time. These in-borne bahaviours are gene-driven perfectly, otherwise. In other words, babies are least spoiled by the culture, and give a sh** about cultural pressures. On the other hand, the shorther time parents 1 stay with a newborn, the more vulnerable to the cultural pressures they are. A decent proxy for this time can be reflected with the data 2 on length of maternity leave per country, as from doi:\nA quiet smile crosses my face whenever I hear something like “my 2 mo son is unable to get used to the bottle” or “my 4 mo daughter finally likes sleeping in her own room”. You are challenging evolution, you expect measurable outcomes in weeks? I am not saying you should not try, your edge is that Homo sapiens brain is amazingly plastic and capable to carry out widely diverse tasks. As one of my beloved Nobel prize winners, Frances H. Arnold, put it: “They 3 are like grad students: they are selected for working long hours at low pay, and you can do that, but maybe you can also play piano? Or do dishes, if you had to?”. Know your opponent, however. And if sth is not working as described on a parenting blog or in an Instagram reel, do not blame yourself as a non-mighty parent. Remember: we are all heirs of the victors. Babies who cried outside were eaten by predators. Thank you for reading and happy parenting."

    "section": "",
    "text": "What a delicious contradiction it is: to be and not to be path dependent at the same time. In the post “Thermodynamics 101 for Investors” I drew an analogy between function state, in thermodynamical sense, and investment outcomes. I claimed that the financial result you harvest does not depend on the ups and downs the stock price makes on a way. I claimed that these results solely depend on the price at start and the price at end points. It might sound counter-intuitive, but it is so. If you haven’t read the mentioned post yet, it is worth giving a try!\nFunny enough, in economy there is a notion of path dependence. Even funnier, path dependence is related to the investment outcome. You can read a great article on this topic on the Best Interest blog, where Jesse Cramer illustrates path dependence with plausible investment of NASA researcher, Sally Ride. Spoiler alert: path of each investor is bumpy and different. It can be averaged, but it is never the average.\nThe seemingly contradictory ways in which investment relates to the path have left me with a sort of Schrödinger’s cat situation, which I am going to wrestle a bit in the paragraphs below.\nJust as our macroscopic intuitions fall short in helping us grasp quantum physics phenomena 1, financial shortcuts are often unhelpful as well. As such faulty financial intuition, I mean here the 7% return rule. The rule is widely used among index fund investors to estimate yearly return from stock investment. Looking at different historical paths, we will see how (surprisingly often) the 7% rule is far from the truth. Ok, but let’s start by saying what the 7% return rule is. It is an assumption that many investors make that in the long term, investment in broad stocks market returns 7% per year. As a careful reader might notice, “long term” is vaguely defined, or, being honest, not defined at all. For my 5-year-old son summer holidays is long term. For Warren Buffett “indefinitely” is long term. Recently I listened to a podcast, which described research about romantic relationships among university students. When asked about “long term relationship” the working definition was “lasting more than 3 months”. Writing these words in January, long-term meter of a 5-year-old is more conservative than the one of gen-Z. In this post, when I refer to “long term” I mean a decade or more - a span that represents a major part of a person’s life. Down the road I will make claims and conclusions based on data on US stock market returns compiled by Yale economist Robert Shiller, known as Shiller data 2.\nI feel a sort of an imperative to give more details on what this data is and what it is not 3. Still, all what matter for this post is that Shiller data are consistent, available and cover relatively long time, and as such they are good to draw some plots. And conclusions. However, they are not representative for any other than American market. Also, history rhymes but does not repeat, and as such past performance is not a prognosis of future returns. Yet, studying history is to avoid mistakes of the past. All that said, let’s have a look at the first plot."

    "text": "Zoom in: Check Different Historical Time Ranges\nIn the second plot, you can play by yourself. It is built on the same data, but it recalculates average returns depending on the chosen start year. You can test how average returns look like for different periods of time, because they are highly dependent on the starting year. If you examine the post-war prosperity period, you will see that the returns average to ~9% yearly. Subtract 2% for inflation and you have a 7% yearly return. Now let’s check 2000 -2010: 1%. Not fun, yeah? Shifting whole decade by 2 years 2002-2012 gives 1.7%, 70% more but still far from 7% yearly. Waiting till 2015 yielded 4.8% yearly. How strikingly different it is from 16.4% of nineties. You can explore what was the most fortunate and the most unfortunate period to invest in US stocks, and play with its length 4.\n\n\n\n\nStart Year: \n\n\n\nEnd Year: \n\n\nUpdate Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you tried multiple ranges, have you noticed how the blue line wiggles at the beginning, regardless of when you start? And then, after ~20 years the average gets stable. The further from the start you go, the harder it is to move the needle. So here is a question, should anybody care about average returns? If all goes well, you should have more money as the time progress. It means that return in the 20th year of investment mean nominally much more than return in the 3rd year. Is there any occasion when the value of average returns is useful? I think it is useful on at least two occasions: if you want to compare asset classes. It is meaningful to say, by average stocks return 3% more than bonds. Also, the 7% return rule provides a very useful mental model to think about exponential growth: if something grows 7% a year, it doubles the initial capital after a decade 5.\nIt brings me back to the original contradiction. Is investment result path dependent and path independent at the same time? Well, it is, if we stick to the existing naming convention. As you just saw by playing with the time ranges for average cumulative return calculations, the trace wiggles at the beginning and averages after decade or two. In this way I think a better name for the effect should have initial conditions, not path, in name. Initial conditions dependency. Similar like for weather forecast models. It is not only about the destination, but also about the journey. Thank you for reading."

    "text": "What a delicious contradiction it is: to be and not to be path dependent at the same time. In the post “Thermodynamics 101 for Investors” I drew an analogy between function state, in thermodynamical sense, and investment outcomes. I claimed that the financial result you harvest does not depend on the ups and downs the stock price makes on a way. I claimed that these results solely depend on the price at start and the price at end points. It might sound counter-intuitive, but it is so. If you haven’t read the mentioned post yet, it is worth giving a try!\nFunny enough, in economy there is a notion of path dependence. Even funnier, path dependence is related to the investment outcome. You can read a great article on this topic on the Best Interest blog, where Jesse Cramer illustrates path dependence with plausible investment of NASA researcher, Sally Ride. Spoiler alert: path of each investor is bumpy and different. It can be averaged, but it is never the average.\nThe seemingly contradictory ways in which investment relates to the path have left me with a sort of Schrödinger’s cat situation, which I am going to wrestle a bit in the paragraphs below.\nJust as our macroscopic intuitions fall short in helping us grasp quantum physics phenomena 1, financial shortcuts are often unhelpful as well. As such faulty financial intuition, I mean here the 7% return rule. The rule is widely used among index fund investors to estimate yearly return from stock investment. Looking at different historical paths, we will see how (surprisingly often) the 7% rule is far from the truth. Ok, but let’s start by saying what the 7% return rule is. It is an assumption that many investors make that in the long term, investment in broad stocks market returns 7% per year. As a careful reader might notice, “long term” is vaguely defined, or, being honest, not defined at all. For my 5-year-old son summer holidays is long term. For Warren Buffett “indefinitely” is long term. Recently I listened to a podcast, which described research about romantic relationships among university students. When asked about “long term relationship” the working definition was “lasting more than 3 months”. Writing these words in January, long-term meter of a 5-year-old is more conservative than the one of gen-Z. In this post, when I refer to “long term” I mean a decade or more - a span that represents a major part of a person’s life. Down the road I will make claims and conclusions based on data on US stock market returns compiled by Yale economist Robert Shiller, known as Shiller data 2.\nI feel a sort of an imperative to give more details on what this data is and what it is not 3. Still, all what matter for this post is that Shiller data are consistent, available and cover relatively long time, and as such they are good to draw some plots. And conclusions. However, they are not representative for any other than American market. Also, history rhymes but does not repeat, and as such past performance is not a prognosis of future returns. Yet, studying history is to avoid mistakes of the past. All that said, let’s have a look at the first plot."

Green solid trace represents yearly nominal returns, expressed in percentages, %. The line helps to guide your sight from datapoint to datapoint. If you hover your finger over green trace, you can see returns for a particular year. Eg. it was -24.5% in 1975, 33.5% in 1976 and 7.5% in 1977. Overall, when you look at the green trace you see many ups and downs. It is hard to answer the question “what typically the US stock market returns?” On the other hand, blue dashed line shows what happens when you cumulatively average yearly returns. The trace starts bumpy but smoothens out the further from the start you are. You see that from ~ year 2000 the returns average to 6% yearly. With this trace you can immediately answer the question: what did the stock market return on average from 1871 to 1950? (and now hover over blue dashed line for 1950). A bonus: if you made it that far in the post, you can isolate the blue trace by clicking on it in the plot legend."

It is built on the same data, but it recalculates average returns depending on the chosen start year. You can test how average returns look like for different periods of time, because they are highly dependent on the starting year. If you examine the post-war prosperity period, you will see that the returns average to ~9% yearly. Subtract 2% for inflation and you have a 7% yearly return. Now let’s check 2000 -2010: 1%. Not fun, yeah? Shifting whole decade by 2 years 2002-2012 gives 1.7%, 70% more but still far from 7% yearly. Waiting till 2015 yielded 4.8% yearly. How strikingly different it is from 16.4% of nineties.

And then, after ~20 years the average gets stable. The further from the start you go, the harder it is to move the needle. So here is a question, should anybody care about average returns? If all goes well, you should have more money as the time progress. It means that return in the 20th year of investment mean nominally much more than return in the 3rd year. Is there any occasion when the value of average returns is useful? I think it is useful on at least two occasions: if you want to compare asset classes. It is meaningful to say, by average stocks return 3% more than bonds. Also, the 7% return rule provides a very useful mental model to think about exponential growth: if something grows 7% a year, it doubles the initial capital after a decade 5.\nIt brings me back to the original contradiction. Is investment result path dependent and path independent at the same time? Well, it is, if we stick to the existing naming convention. As you just saw by playing with the time ranges for average cumulative return calculations, the trace wiggles at the beginning and averages after decade or two. In this way I think a better name for the effect should have initial conditions, not path, in name. Initial conditions dependency. Similar like for weather forecast models. It is not only about the destination, but also about the journey. Thank you for reading."

    "text": "Winter 2020/21 was the timing of my maternity leave. The world was spinning after surreal 2020 spring but with numbers on infections and hospitalisations order of magnitude higher, and with no vaccine in sight. Meeting people outdoors was the only possible form of socializing. Having data from my first child who was much better sleeper outside than inside, I had already two reasons for long daily walks. Luckily, a friend of mine had a baby in the same time, so that I had someone to socialize with. Together with Carmen we spent hours in crispy air, strolling, eating cakes from Julie’s house and talking. One day I remember convincing her to make one extra round in the park, because I knew the moment I return home my son will wake up and claim, lound and clear, his milk. ‘Caveman baby.’ she said, and I gazed at her. ‘When you reach home it is a sign that the walk for today is over. In the place where air is stagnated everyone is safe. So he can remind you of his existance and “ask” for feeding’.\nShe was outlaying analogies to the lifestyle of hunter gatherers - nomadic movement, cave, predators at bay. Despite the fact how well researched is this particular claim (Carmen, go for it!), Homo sapiens spent only a fraction of their existence as non-nomads. Aproximately 10%. Evolutionary luggage is the heavier the longer it was carried. As such we are genetically shaped more by hunter gatherers than by any lifestyle that followed (sedentary, with artificial light or with artificial intelligence - pick up one for this lost competition). It makes perfect sense that babies are naturally wired to sleep outdoors and to start crying when you enter home. Or stop on a red light, if you are a car person.\nSleeping preferences of babies is something that make many parents sleepless. Co-sleeping or not co-sleeping? How old is too old for milk at night? Should you comfort when it cries or let it cry-it-out? Or something in between and if yes, after how much time? When to move a baby to their room? Every parent was confronted with these questions, and every future parent will be. Cultural pressures. Timeline of a newborn can be viewed as a recency example, too. A few month old baby is exposed to cultural pressures regarding sleep, feeding and comfort seekeing for a relatively short time. These in-borne bahaviours are gene-driven perfectly, otherwise. In other words, babies are least spoiled by the culture, and give a sh** about cultural pressures. On the other hand, the shorther time parents 1 stay with a newborn, the more vulnerable to the cultural pressures they are. A decent proxy for this time can be reflected with the data 2 on length of maternity leave per country, as from doi:\nA quiet smile crosses my face whenever I hear something like “my 2 mo son is unable to get used to the bottle” or “my 4 mo daughter finally likes sleeping in her own room”. You are challenging evolution, you expect measurable outcomes in weeks? I am not saying you should not try, your edge is that Homo sapiens brain is amazingly plastic and capable to carry out widely diverse tasks. As one of my beloved Nobel prize winners, Frances H. Arnold, put it: “They 3 are like grad students: they are selected for working long hours at low pay, and you can do that, but maybe you can also play piano? Or do dishes, if you had to?”. Know your opponent, however. And if sth is not working as described on a parenting blog or in an Instagram reel, do not blame yourself as a non-mighty parent. Remember: we are all heirs of the victors. Babies who cried outside were eaten by predators. Thank you for reading and happy parenting."
